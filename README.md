# trader-analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of trader behavior relative to market sentiment cycles. As part of a Junior Data Scientist selection process, this project demonstrates the ability to:

Resolve Technical Debt: Corrected critical Unix epoch timestamp unit mismatches (the '1970 bug') to ensure accurate temporal alignment.

Extract Behavioral Insights: Quantified shifts in trading frequency, win rates, and long/short biases during market extremes.

Predictive Modeling: Built a Random Forest Classifier to categorize next-day trader profitability based on current behavior and sentiment.

User Segmentation: Leveraged Unsupervised Learning (K-Means) to define behavioral archetypes for personalized risk management.
